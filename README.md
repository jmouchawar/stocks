# Forecasting Stock Growth

### Summary

Here is a project that explores and forecasts stock movement using a LogNormal Random Walk. After conducting an EDA, we simulate multiple forecasts and visualize them. We then use methods of proof to show the expected value and variance of any n-step ahead prediction. Using the results from those proofs, we construct an expected forecast and confidence interval for that forecast.
